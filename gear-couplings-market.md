<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gear Couplings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rigid Gear Couplings</li><li>Flex Gear Couplings</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The gear couplings market consists of two primary types: rigid gear couplings and flexible gear couplings. Rigid gear couplings typically consist of two hubs and a series of gear teeth, providing a strong connection for high torque applications, ensuring precise alignment without any misalignment compensation. Flexible gear couplings, on the other hand, allow for some misalignment, accommodating axial, angular, and radial displacement, which makes them suitable for applications with varying loads and dynamic conditions, enhancing system reliability and performance.</p></p>
